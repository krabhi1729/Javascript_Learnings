When we run a JavaScript program, it goes through two main phases: the Memory Creation Phase and the Code Execution Phase. Let's break down each phase step by step:

1. `Memory Creation Phase:`

In this phase, JavaScript allocates memory for variables and functions. It does not execute any code during this phase. Instead, it scans the entire code and sets up memory space for each variable and function. It assigns a special value called undefined to variables and stores the function's code in memory for later execution.

Let's consider the code snippet you provided:

```js

var n = 2;
function square(num) {
  var ans = num * num;
  return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```
During the memory creation phase, JavaScript sets up memory for n, square, square2, and square4.

At this point, the memory would look something like this:

```vbnet

n: undefined
square: [Function code]
square2: undefined
square4: undefined
```
2.`Code Execution Phase:`

In this phase, JavaScript executes the code line by line.

a. First, it encounters var n = 2; and assigns the value 2 to n. Now, n becomes 2.

b. Next, it encounters the function square(num) { ... }. Since functions are first-class citizens in JavaScript, it stores the entire function code in the memory space assigned for the square variable.

c. It moves on to var square2 = square(n);. This is where things get interesting. When JavaScript encounters a function call, it creates a new execution context for that function. An execution context represents a scope where variables and functions are stored during the function's execution.

Let's say, for the execution of square(n), a new execution context is created, and memory is allocated for the function's parameter num and local variable ans. At this point, the memory looks like:

```makefile

n: 2
square: [Function code]
square2: undefined
square4: undefined
[num]: undefined
[ans]: undefined
```
d. Now, JavaScript executes the function code. It assigns the value 2 to num (the parameter of square). It calculates ans = num * num, which is ans = 2 * 2, so ans becomes 4. Finally, it encounters return ans;, which returns the value of ans (4) to the line var square2 = square(n);.

e. Since the function execution is complete, the execution context for square(n) is popped off the Call Stack (more on Call Stack later). Now, the memory looks like:

```makefile

n: 2
square: [Function code]
square2: 4
square4: undefined
[num]: undefined
[ans]: undefined
```
f. The same process is repeated for var square4 = square(4);, creating a new execution context for square(4), calculating square4 as 16, and then popping the function's execution context off the Call Stack.

`Call Stack:`

The Call Stack is a data structure that keeps track of the execution context of your JavaScript code. It follows a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) approach, meaning the last function that is added to the stack is the first one to be executed and removed. Each time a function is called, its execution context is pushed onto the Call Stack, and when the function finishes executing, its execution context is popped off the Call Stack.

In the example above, the Call Stack would look like:

```rust

(square(4)) -> (square(n)) -> Global Execution Context
```
At the end of the execution, the Call Stack will be empty, indicating that the program has finished executing.

Remember, the Call Stack is an essential concept for understanding how JavaScript manages the flow of execution and maintains proper scoping for variables and functions.
